    "### What this course is.\n",
    "* This course is designed to be an introduction to data science specifically using Python. Data Science can be done in many languages but the two most popular are Python and R. R has many great packages and functionality just as Python does. Python was chosen for a couple reasons, but most importantly I felt it was the more versatile of the two languages. This means I felt you'd be more likely to need it in your lifetime because you're more likely to see/use it. Python is a lead for Data Science but is used for major software engineering as well as Web Development and many more topics. The second reason was that I know Python better than R so when I get a random Python question in class I'm more likely to know the answer. This course will emphasize finance since that's my domain but will give examples to other areas and how the ideas transcend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this course is not.\n",
    "* This course is not an advanced course in any specific area. The major topics of data science will be touched upon. Data Science is an extremely broad field so any individual topic could be it's on PhD dissertation. My objective is to give you enough tools and insight that if you ran into a data set that needed analysis you'd be comfortable enough to go through the data science workflow and extrapolate insights that would be helpful.<br/>\n",

    "Jupyter Notebook is a multi-dimensional IDE(integrated development environment). It's what you're reading on now and will construct your code in.

    "\n",
    "DataCamp is an online resource for Data Science classes. There are many places to learn data science but I personally felt they abstracted away a lot of the mess and allow you to start coding real data science right away. I believe this is the best way to teach data science since it initially gets students (and myself) excited about the abilities of data science and new techniques and tools. I believe if you make someone excited about a topic they will then go out of their way to learn the \"boring\" topics or more rigorous mathematics to supplement their knowledge. This is the exact path I took in Data Science.<br/>\n",
